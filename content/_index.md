# Introduction

Welcome to the blog section of my website.

Be comfortable to read any topics I'm learning or writing about on the sidebar menu.

## Reason

There are mainly two reasons for the existence of this blog:

1. To gather all my content in one place
2. To avoid too much AI content being dumped on the internet alongside my content

### All content in one place

I'm not really interested in doing one and only one thing, so it's kinda hard to have the content of the things I create scattered around the web, it's hard to maintain and to send to other people.

Some documents, images, resources, repositories, code snippets, tutorials and links. Everything in one place.

But mostly an extension of my portfolio, that you can check [here!](https://falme.com.br/)

### AI content dump

Usually, I post my documents and studies on my social media or dev.to, but I was thinking, "What if the website decides to remove my post, or the website is no longer available?" So, I decided to migrate to my own website, where I can have control over it.

Also the website dev.to became a race to post how to use AI in everything, images, essays, everything made by machine, it became not viable for me. There's a race for attention that does not vibe with me.

## Static website

This is a static website, made with Hugo (Gohugo), and the theme is Hugo-Book. This means that the website is very lightweight, and if something bad happens, it does not depend on an external server to be rendered, making it possible to be saved in places like the Wayback Machine.

Or you can just download it yourself.

That being said, content will be added from time to time, there's no posting routine, so I'm not expecting you to be returning for new content, so no worries.
