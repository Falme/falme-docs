# Microcorruption - Sydney

Microcorruption gives us a debugger and a password to unlock a device, our job is to find the password reading through assembly code and using some reverse engineering tricks. Each challenge is named after a city, each one more difficult than the previous one.

If you didn't solve the challenge for yourself, I recommend that you stop reading, solve the challenge and check my solution afterwards, do not spoil the challenge and have fun.
