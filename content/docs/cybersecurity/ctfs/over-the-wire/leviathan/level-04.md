# Over The Wire - Leviathan - Level 04

## Steps

After connecting to leviathan4, we can see in the content of the home directory with `ls -la` that we have a hidden directory called ".trash" and inside it there's an executable file named "bin"

Executing the "bin" file returns with a binary text. 

This one is very simple, just put the binary into some "binary to text converter" online or using cyberchef and the password for the next level will be revealed.
